# Vesper GTM Engine

The "Vesper" GTM Engine is composed of four core components, each playing a specific role in the lead generation and management process.

## Core Components

### 1. The Scout (Ingestion Agent)
Responsible for ingesting raw leads from LinkedIn/Reddit, filtering them against an ICP score, and saving them to Firestore.

### 2. The Strategist (Logic Agent)
Responsible for reading active leads, using LLMs to draft personalized messages, and deciding if a lead needs "Human Review" or can be "Auto-Queued" based on intent scores.

### 3. The Executor (Delivery Agent)
A strict stateless worker that reads from the task_queue, respects API rate limits (max 30/day), and triggers the actual API calls via Unipile/Reddit.

### 4. Antigravity (The Dashboard)
A Next.js UI used by humans to review, edit, and approve drafts generated by The Strategist.

## 5. Infrastructure Standards (DeckSmith)
### 🚨 The 3 Golden Rules
1. **Region:** ALWAYS use `europe-west2` (London).
2. **Access:** NO public IPs. NO `allUsers`.
3. **Safety:** `deletion_protection = true` on ALL stateful resources (Databases, Buckets).
🏗️ Approved Patterns
Public Web Service: Load Balancer -> Cloud Armor -> Cloud Run (Internal Ingress).

Secure Bucket: Private + CMEK + Versioning + Uniform Access.
